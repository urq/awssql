Tables
======

A table is a line oriented set of strings of the following form:
* One line of headers delimited by `delimiter` (a `tab` by default).
* Zero or more lines of data delimited by `delimiter`.
Should we have an optional typing mechanism in the header? How much benefit does that add?

Examples
========
# how many instances are in the VPC 'vpc-00028f24'?
get ec2_instances | filter VpcId == vpc-00028f24 | agg count

# how many m4.larges are in the VPC 'vpc-00028f24'?
get ec2_instances | filter VpcId == vpc-00028f24 and InstanceType == m4.large | agg count

# how many of each instance type are in the VPC 'vpc-41928f24'?
get ec2_instances | filter VpcId == vpc-00028f24 | group_by InstanceType | agg count
